I recently moved to North Hatley from Montreal. Over Christmas, my aunt was telling me about our family history in the Eastern Townships.

When I got back to Quebec after the Christmas break, I started looking into our family history with various online resources. I set up a bit of a family tree using a subscription to ancestry.ca. 

Here's a bit of what I've learned...

The Frizzle family moved to the Eaton/Compton area in the early 1800s. My great(x3) grandfather, Orsamus Frizzle, moved there from New Hampshire. 

I think that both Elvira, Randall and Benjamin are Orsamus' kids.

Abbie Jane was the wife of my great(x2) grandfather, Ezra. Ezra was one of Orsamus' children.

Laura was one of Ezra's 3 children. The other two are my great-grandfather, Roy, and Arthur W.

The family of Ezra Frizzle is written about along with a photo in the book ["History of Compton County"](https://www.myheritage.com/research/collection-90100/compilation-of-published-sources?itemId=2292297&action=showRecord)
